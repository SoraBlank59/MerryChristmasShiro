          <h1>Dear, sheyla,shala,shola,sala,shaka</h1>
          <p> all these different names we give you and we laugh at all of them, it’s been more than a year since i’ve known you and it has been by far the best times i’ve had, you met me at my worst and seen me at my best and you were there when i needed someone and felt alone, you are more then just a simple friend to me and i never actually call someone my best friend, yes we have had our ups and our downs but i am willing to fight for our friendship as it is one i never want to lose, i see you in my future along with the other rascals and being with you is so much fun, i don’t think i’ve had a better friend group in my life which makes you so special, i don’t think i will ever get over our friend ship and we are always thinking the same, judging the same, and in sync sooo many times, when your not here everyone asks me about you bc we are always together and i am so quiet in the classes i don’t have you, you bring out the fun and the good in me, I LOVE YOU SHALAAAAA &heartsuit; MERRY CHRISTMAS!
