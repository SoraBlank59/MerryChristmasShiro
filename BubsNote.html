          <h1>Dear sheyla, Ana, Itzumi, and Shiro,</h1>
          <p>12/3/23 I hope this Christmas you got everything you could ever want and more. I began work on this website on december 3rd 2023 and it just turned midnight making it december 4th now. Usually when I start a big project like this I'm super scared I won't get it done in time but I know I'll get this finished. I really want you to have a home page to open your browser to every day that shows you just how much everyone loves you.

<p> 12/25/23 Merry Christmas to the most important person in my life
It's crazy to me that It's already Christmas again. It feels like it was just yesterday that we had that Christmas where *everything was bad*. I love you so much and knowing we get to spend this holiday together and every single one after this makes me so fucking happy. without you In my life I'm honestly not sure where I would be. I've never had someone I can fully confide in and im still getting used to that but I know for sure Without you my life would be 1000 times worse. I can not wait for when we can spend christmas together in person. I want to build snowmen, make snow angels, have snowball fights. everything. Merry Christmas ana, I hope Its an amazing one (or at least better than that one T-T )
