          <h1>Dear, sheyla</h1>
          <p> I’m sure that we can both agree that our friendship has come a long way. I don’t think that I could’ve ever predicted that we’d become as close as  we are now. When I first met you I thought that we wouldn’t get along because of how headstrong you can be. But now it’s one of my favorite things about you. Now I can say that I’m happy that our other friend group dissolved the way that it did lol. I love being able to talk shit about them with you. But, I also love how I can sit in silence with you without it being awkward. Especially because we both know that I don’t like talking much. I honestly don’t know how I was lucky enough to meet you. I think that the only thing I regret in our friendship is that I don’t get to spend as much time as I’d want to with you and the other two rats that we call friends. I hope that that’ll change soon. I can’t wait to see where our friendship takes the four of us.
            I love you rat </p>
